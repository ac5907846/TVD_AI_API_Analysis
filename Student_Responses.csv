1,I remember a description of different teams working on the project and how they can work best together.Â ,That projects have many different people coming together to work on something and there is always something you can improve,The problems between teams of people working on a project
2,I remember that TVD involves the focus on designing for a price rather than the actual structure at hand for constraints.,"Economy isnt always the deciding factor, people are stingy and selfish with funds, and longer planning and preparation can lead to cheaper projects overall.",I think TVD was created to address the problem of projects going over budget by the end.
3,saving money and cutting costs without sacrificing quality,"budget is very I'm important, it knowing how to get the most out of your money is a key skill in project management.","Maximizing the quality and boosting performance of a project with also saving money, which everyone likes."
4,I remembered that TVD is being organize to complete a project,"1. Scope managementÂ 

2. Team management

3.Cost managementÂ Â ",Scope management cause this
5,"it is a combination of cost, scope, change, and team management including stakeholder engagement","create buy-ins, how to deal with uncertainty,and dealing with conflicting stakeholders",managing pace of workÂ 
6,target value design is a method used in construction and project management to set a specific cost target early in the planning process. Rather than determining a budget based on available funds.,"people pleasing is a part of Constuction.

sometimes compromises have to be made.

Â Each project is different.","It was likely created to address challenges in the construction and design industry related to cost overruns, inefficient project delivery, and the need for a more collaborative and value-driven approach to construction projects."
7,We converted a pros vs cons list into a graph and values to compare different choices,"Delivering the most value to the customer, time constraints, and budget",Decisions that may be made with personal bias can now be drawn out and made with a visual representation of pros vs cons.
8,"Sometimes you need to cut costs in some areas, like furnishing, in order to minimize costs. If anything, you can always update the interior in the future.","Collaboration is important, as well as decision-making based on values, and sometimes it's better to cut costs when, for example, aesthetically pleasing furnishing isn't necessary.Â ",How to maximize project value and minimize costs.
9,we looked into lots of different topics and the one who stood out to me was the hospital one where we needed to look at why that location is the best,"there are always things you can do to optimize the project

there is a lot more things that go into a project then i thought

it takes a lot of risks to get projects to be efficient and save money",it is used to lower the cost without reducing the quality of final project
10,You have to use different methods depending on what part you are trying to solve.,"1. Choice by advantageÂ 

2. Effective Communication

3. How to deal with multiple stakeholders and their varying opinions",It's used to bring down the price of a project without compromising the integrity of the project.
11,Target value design helps find a way to please everybody with reasoning,"Attributes,

Stakeholders.Â ",Created do address dealing with stakeholdersÂ 
12,"There is a stakeholder conflict on the construction of the new hospital campus in Cocoa Beach. There is also an increase in the construction cost, the owner budgeted $740/ft but the actual construction cost is $960/ft. therefore, as a project manager, it should be a meeting between to stakeholders and the owner to get to an agreement to reduce the the cost of the project. They could reevaluate the want-have and just create a good enough building that can satisfy the needs of the health campus. They could also issue a bond or get a loan from the government to get closer to the construction cost. Finally, TVD is created to afront construction conflicts and dilemmas between stakeholders and reach a target value that can satisfy everyone's needs, while complying with the budget.","How to convince owner and stakeholder to reduce construction cost

Way to reduce the cost

The design of the target value where is accounts for allowances","TVD is typically developed to tackle issues related to cost overruns, budget constraints, and inefficient project delivery. It emphasizes early collaboration between project stakeholders, such as owners, designers, and contractors, to establish a target cost for a project that aligns with the client's value expectations. Â TVD seeks to optimize project outcomes, reduce waste, and enhance the overall efficiency and value of construction projects. it is often encounter in Transportation field were you have to get on board different stakeholder with different views on the project."
13,I remember it as a game plan with more intricate parts as well as a financial aspect to all the decisions done within the team.,"Collaboration is essential in TVD

Optimizing value over the costs

Continuous improvement and early planning",Cost overruns along with scope changes. I also think it addresses the lack of collaboration within a project.
14,"Choosing by AdvantagesÂ

15,"Requires a lot of effort/convincing to implement, but offers a diverse amount of beneftis at various levels of the project (stakeholder, PM, workers)","Collaboration

Probably cost benefits

its harder to implement the bigger the project is since more individuals are involved in decision making","Compartmentalizing a variety of project phases and pointing blame from that.Â  Obviously, finances is always an issue, but I think the bigger reason TVD was created was for better accountability. By involving individual teams throughout the project, there is a more clear understanding of what the expectations are. Now that everyone is mildly involved, miscommunication or ignorance cant really be used as an excuse for poor quality or late work, as the entire project outline is a collaborative effort of every team involved."
16,TVD is about targeting important aspects of a project and identifying key cost components in order to conserve money in some parts to preserve other areas.,"Use CBA for decision making processes

Costs can be cut in specific areas, and increased in others while still saving money

Projects are like trees, altering one branch can effect dozens.Â ","One aspect it would address is the issue of groups working independently from the rest of the project. Sometimes it can save time, but when a team only focuses on their own tasks, it can create unnecessary challenges to the group."
17,"Target value design focuses on that facts and distinct advantages of options, as well as considering other forces on a project such as stakeholders. It helps you to think critically on which option would best benefit the overall project and how to utilize the people available to you.Â ","1. CBA can be a better way to compare advantages without repetition or similar attributes

2. Many of the aspects of TVD focus on the benefits and outcomes of a project and account for anyone involved with the project

3. Learning how to think critically about project advantages

How to do an advantage breakdown.

People like to save money.",People not working together effectively.
23,I thought that the overall case study and presentation was very helpful in showing the process of resolving conflicts and problems that may come with being a project manager or even an investor in a project and how to keep the project going,"Internal conflicts, how to choose the best products/materials for the situation, scope of work requirements","TVD was created to address the potential problems in a project such as timelines, decisions on products, and resolving internal conflicts between stakeholders and owners to be able to achieve projects completion on time and within the budgetsÂ "
24,"Target Value Design, helps outline the projects requirements, outline, and deadlines. This will aid in the decision making for stakeholders and project managers.","Cost management, scope management, and team management.Â ",Target Value Design was created to address decisions that need to be made when a lot of parties disagree. It helps all parties come to an agreement.Â 
25,"TVD is the overall concept, which is creating a plan to address any problems that arise during the project","1. Don't simply pick the most expensive option

2. Those who fail to plan, plan to fail

3. Different paper sizes","Problems with cost, scope, change, team, and stakeholders"
26,"Target Value Design can involve the implementation of flexible cost boundaries, where the budget for a project can flow freely among the systems of the project. This can assist with global optimization instead of focusing on local optimization.","* The goal is to increase the project's overall value without reducing expenses.

* Budget can flow freely among the systems if flexible cost boundaries are implemeted.

* Cross-stakeholder funding reallocation is necessary for resource use.","Target Value Design could have been created to address communication issues between stakeholders and owners, along with the teams and companies that are in charge of the design portion of the project. TVD can assist with transparency about advantages, benefits, preferences, and money."
27,TVD is the choosing of the best items based on their qualities,"Learning about how people disagree on the same things, how people can work together to resolve a conflict, how target value design can help resolution of material selection",TVD was made to address people who believe that their way is the best way to do something
28,"Target Value Design takes a project's potential cost and designs the project to fit within the allowable budget cost and perhaps under, which would be known as the target cost or budget. This can include methods such as Choosing by Advantages.","1. Able to differentiate the main advantage for each category.

2. Be able to design a project to have the allowable cost to be the maximum cost for a project, and have the target cost be under.

3. Setting up the TVD for the exterior walls.",Target Value Design was created to address issues with budget allocation as well as potential issues regarding stakeholder wants.
29,"One of the things I remember about TVD is that you must come in with alternatives to what you have in mind, this is to help with any changes in cost, leadership or material availability.Â ","Creating Buy-in with stakeholders, motivating stakeholders to work collaboratively and developing alternatives solutions to a problem","I think TVD was created to address the challenges of time constraints, and how at times this can prevent the final product from having the quality that was first in mind. With this in mind, they work with a cost constraint rather than how the final product will look"
30,Rank advantages to choose an optimal choice.,"Communicate with stakeholders

Choose by advantages

Consider your options","Indecisiveness, conflicting interests between parties, multiple pros and cons of a choice."
31,TVD was used to cut costs to help cut the budget. We considered what areas can get cut and which can gain but also take into consideration what the stakeholders will think.,There are many factors that need to be considered when making cost decisions in a project. There will always be someone who is upset in the decision. Itâ€™s important to include EVERYONE in each decision and process to avoid confusion.Â ,It was design to cut costs by needs not by fairness.
32,Exploring dilemmas and using decision making to solve dilemmas. TVD also showed how to motivate a team and get them to work together. TVD also showed how to prioritize and to what standards to select a method/path to follow.,"Three takeaways are choosing by advantages, prioritizing wants of the owner, and making cost-effective decisions.",TVD was created to address decision making and the assist in efficiency in decision making.
33,I remember that it is possible to determine what the needs and wants of a project are while also delivering the project within the constraints.Â ,"How to address a need vs want

How to resolve a disagreement on a project

how to deal with change during a project

Â 

Â ",This was created to address the disagreements during projects and how to resolve them while also keeping the project of schedule. It also helps when deciding what needs to be done with the budgets to allow the project to stay affordable and not go over budget.
34,I remember a lot about trying to save money and what would be the best ways to manage the project in a way that we can make the project work and still spend less money and keep everyone happy.Â ,"Spending less.,

Keeping the project workplace (workers/people) happy.

Being the most efficient and producing good quality.Â 

Â ",To complete a project with the least amount of spent money and without delaying the project or extending the schedule.Â 
35,"TVD is an approach towards conflict in a project

Â ",Key takeaways included how the perspective and approach canÂ  alter how a situation is handled and how far conflict can run through the chain of funders and such,TVD was created to address challenges within the management of a project as there tends to be conflict around every corner
36,I remember the tight schedule,NA,To help with schedule goals
37,I remember the different example we discussed such as cost management and team management.,"Three key takeaways were the team management, cost management, and stakeholder engagement.",Was intended to address the most important issues.
38,I remembered TVD mainly being about having a strong cohesive plan to present investors and help develop a complete scope of what the project is going to be so there is not much overspending and unrelated work in the project.Â ,"It is very important to have a clear plan of what your project scope is going to be. second list out everything you for completion, need, and want for a project and lastly you need to present you ideas clearly so other can understand them fully",It was created to streamline the planning process of project so invests can comfortably invest into the project as well as understand if the project is well manages or notÂ 
39,I am not sure if I remember but it was where we decide on different choices throughout a project.,"It helps in costs, quality, and time management.Â ",It was designed to address quality of work issues.Â 
40,"The proposed design for the health first hospital, funded by the Lawrence group; has a few must have criteria, like 120 beds, and want criteria, like four floors in the parking garage. In order to address the must have criteria, the design builders must work in a team (thru co-location) to settle on how the money can be appropriately used in an IPD delivery method in such a way that incorporates client needs and keeps every party happy.","1- choosing from advantages helps make everyone have input in the decision making process while finding materials that meet the most needs for the best value

2- leans are meant to make a non conservative cost analysis while ensuring the margin of cost for the general contractor stays the sameÂ 

3- it is important to prioritize the clientâ€™s must haves rather than want to havesÂ ","Address disagreement amongst stakeholders, meet needs of clients, and stay within budget for market and value costs"
41,The idea that I remember after the Target Value Design presentation is that working with people can be difficult due to the unpredictability of human nature.,"Three takeaways are fail to plan is a plan to fail, communication and transparency is key to working as a system, and working with people can be difficult due to humans unpredictable nature.",Target Value Design was created to address the lack of communication between multiple parties when working on a project.
42,Target Value Design is intended to remove any wasteful components of a project and evenly balance a project schedule to organize and output the work in the most efficient manner possible.,"Be aware of your staff's cultural and experienced surroundings.

Choose components of a project wisely to waste the least amount of time.

Manage the money firmly and ensure at least 1 person is highly trusted in recording transactions.","The challenges TVD is designed to address are cost reliability, value delivery, and continuous improvement on large capitalÂ projects.Â "
43,"Different tools to use to practice TVD effectively, like the sticky note method",NA,Problems with coersive progress towards a common goal between options
44,The choosing by advantages method is extremely important in decision making,"you can still make spaghetti without expensive ingredients

those who fail to plan, plan to fail

sometimes most expensive is not best",Work place conflict between people who are supposed to be a team
45,From what I can remember the presentation was meant to show what potential issues could arise when planning a project.The presentation has questions to be discussed on how to solve those potential issues then later discussed to the entire class on how other students came out with different answers regarding those questions.,Three key takeaways From what I understand is one stakeholders could cause a potential issue in terms of funding acquisition. Two it is important to understand how funding should be disputed between different systems/trades. Third is how saving fundingÂ  in one system/trade could greatly affect the use of resources in different systems/trade.,From what I can understand the TVD can be used as a standard teaching tool for students and people who are not very familiar working on complex and long projects. It's a simple way to teach potential issues that may arise within the industry that many people are oblivious to.Â 
46,When weighing options for a problem focus on the pros and not the cons. Then organize the pros best on importance.,"Focus on pros not cons, take into consideration more than just price, and that each project may be different based on needs.",Figuring out how to make an informed decision when deciding between alternatives to a problem.
47,I remember the process of deciding which attributes were most important with the best advantages,"1. TVD is a great way to schedule projects

2. Teams must work as a system

3. The most expensive option is not always the best",TVD was created to address challenges related to project cost and ensuring that the designed value aligns with the target cost.Â 
48,I remember TVD to be a management practice to decide on design and construction parameters that meet the project's goals.,"1. Stakeholders sometimes have conflicting wants and needs that all need to be balanced and addressed.

2. Even when a specific criteria may be the most advantageous, if the cost is too high, then it won't be used.

3. A large part of the management process is making sure all of the stakeholders are on the same page and work together.",TVD was created to select the most efficient design and construction parameters based off the needs of stakeholders.

It was also created as a template as to pick the best material for the job."
52,"I recall the kitchen metaphor, it really allowed me to grasp the concept. Ensuring that you should not continue or cut corners on a project if you have no funds.","I would say three key takeaways I got from the lesson were to make sure you will profit from the beginning, stop the project completely if you canâ€™t have a quality build or have to take short cuts, and the need of good communication.",I feel TVD was created to address the problems of structural failures by cutting funding just to complete a project.
53,I remembered the hospital location challenge and why they were deciding on different cities.,"Offer different options to show cost, delivery speed and safety.

Communication with stakeholder to create buy in

Recognize ""must haves"" and ""wants""","It was created to solve a variety of problems between owners and general contractors, TVD gives insight from both sides and solutions to most common problems in communication and decision making."
54,Target Value Design can be described as being proactive with Value Engineering. It is the ability to satisy all stakeholders without succumbing to financial restraints.,"Three takeways that I learned from the lesson are:

* To recognize cost/financial restraints

* Be wary of conflicting stakeholder needs

* Work to motivate stakeholders to collaborate","One major challenge that TVD addresses is the task of satisfying all of the project stakeholders. This is impossible to do without going over budget on the project, which would dissatisfy all stakesholders."
55,it is a method of devising proper use of costs and how to utilize it to get the most profit while still getting the result to be what the owners want. this is done through cost management at the beginning of the project and how problems could be managed in the long run. this is to get the cost as close to what is estimated as possible and giving the most optimal return on the project.Â ,"1) the understanding of what target value design is

2) the benefits of the target value design

3) also the understanding of why someone would use target value design on a projectÂ ","it was created to adress problems that occur fast and without warning such as price hikes for materials, problems with the distribution of materials, or worker shortages.Â "
56,Id say the kitchen metaphor and how you can operate on a fixed budget,"Working with your budget, working with people, working with conflicting mindsets",The main one is settling arguments about whats most importat in a project and finding compromise

Communication is key.

Focus on the value of the project, not the cost.Â ",Agreement of design specifications that may be different amongst team members; conflict resolution strategy.
58,"I understand that it implements many different forms of management that includes cost management, scope maagement, change management, team management, and stakeholder engagement.","how to get stakeholders to buy in, deciding how to make decisions whether it is for best safety or performance, and team management",i was designed to tackle conflicting opinions on the decisions that need to be made when working on projects
59,"TVD starts at the early stages of design and decision-making. It involves identifying opportunities for cost savings, efficiency improvements, and value enhancements without compromising project quality or functionality. TVD is used to consider all owner and stakeholder's needs and wants to deliver the best outcome for everyone.Â ","TVD can be used at any stage of the project.

TVD promotes communication and collaboration.

TVD helps find the best solution to an issue while staying within budget and schedule.","TVD was created to mitigate challenges during a construction project by emphasizing collaboration, efficiency, and value throughout the project. TVD optimizes project outcomes by delivering maximum value within specified budget and schedule constraints."
60,"TVD was presented as a means to foster innovation and creativity while ensuring projects remained within budget and schedule constraints. It emphasized early collaboration among stakeholders to optimize designs for cost-effectiveness without sacrificing quality or functionality. The process involved setting target values for key metrics such as cost, schedule, and quality, and then iteratively refining designs to meet these targets.

One key aspect was the involvement of all project stakeholders, including designers, contractors, and clients, in decision-making processes. This collaborative approach enabled better communication, transparency, and risk mitigation throughout the project lifecycle.","1) that we cannot compromise on quality when we are trying to stay within budget

2) communication and transparency is key

3) make sure to set clear expectations from the beginning","TVD was created to tackle the challenge of projects exceeding budget or timeline due to design decisions made without considering cost implications. It aims to align project goals with budget constraints from the start by involving all stakeholders in collaborative decision-making to optimize designs for cost-effectiveness without compromising quality or functionality.

Â "
61,I remember there are a number of scenarios that can occur and there can be multiple ways to address these issues and trying to find the best one that works for everyone is crucial.,"1. Project Expectations

2. Cost Management

3. Developing and Selecting Alternative Solutions",I think TVD was created to address different management skills and how to solve issues that arise between the project manager and the stakeholders.Â 
62,"TVD is a project delivery method that emphasizes collaboration, informed decision-making, and value-driven outcomes. It was created to address challenges in the construction industry such as cost overruns, inaccurate estimates, and frequent design changes. TVD sets cost as a design constraint rather than an outcome, aiming to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of project delivery. It promotes an incremental and trended approach to handle the pressure on preconstruction teams and makes cost, value, and constructability the drivers of design.

In the case study and presentation, we discussed how TVD and other methods like â€œChoosing by Advantagesâ€ can be applied in real-world scenarios. For instance, when selecting exterior wall systems for hospital faÃ§ades, we considered factors like economics, safety, and aesthetics. All these factors are crucial, but their relative importance depends on the specific context and priorities. This is a practical example of how TVD can guide decision-making in construction projects.","* The needs of Target Value Design.

* Methods and practices used in target value design.

* Details for evaluating problems in a complex design.","Target Value Design (TVD) addresses key challenges in the construction industry. It aims to prevent cost overruns and delays, improve accuracy of estimates, balance quality, schedule, and cost, minimize design changes, and reduce pressure on preconstruction teams. Essentially, it makes cost, value, and constructability the drivers of design.

Â "
63,"Target Value Design is the estimated design of a project, this covers different areas such as time, design, and cost","Project Design, Setting Target Costs, and Build to Target Cost","Target Value Design was created to address schedule delays, and communications problems as target value design is both involved early in the construction process and allows to easy communication between owner, cm, and workers"
64,"TVD is often incorporated in a team management manner. Thus, it helps the team address future estimations and how it should be arranged. Cost analysis is extremely important in the design phase. TVD can heighten organization and give the team a more comprehensive approach.","Choose the advatanges

Contribute with team, stakeholders and subcontractor relations",I feel as though TVD was designed to resolve around the challenges of design decision-making. Along with helping describe the core factors to which the project must have in order to be successful and in budget of design features and stakeholder necessities.
65,I remember that a lot of it deals with communication between parties and making sure that everyone is involved and knows what stage and area the project is on.,"cost management

team organization

Stakeholder engagement",I think it helps to fix the challenge of being prepared for problems on the project between stakeholders and owners.
66,"I remember that there are specific requirements and wants from a owner and that can be decided using TVD between the owner, GC, and stakeholders.","That the owner, GC, and stakeholders play a big role in deciding how a project turns out, and whether or not it was profitable when it comes to the schedule, design desicions, and more.",I think it was created to address both the wants/needs of the owner and the conflicting ideas/budget of the GC. It was made to come to a consensus.
67,"Target Value Design pertains to getting the best value for you project needs in accordance to your budget. It requires an active approach, where you have to observe what's not working and what is wasting resources. In the process you work together with various groups to create a project with the best quality and cost-effectiveness. It structuralized on these accords:Â 

* Cost Management

* Scope Management

* Change Management

* Team Management

* Cost Management

* Scope Management","Target Value Design was developed to help maintain a healthy project costs and promote value optimization.Â  Usually project can have overrun costs that can destroy the whole project. TVD helps create a plan that sets a proper project cost that aligns with their project needs. It helps limit excess costs. It also ties with value optimization, you add or develop valuable needs while limiting excess costs."

71,That Target Value Design makes decision based of design and target costs. As well as multiple people are helping to make decisions and of course to prevent value engineering.,"1. Prevents value engineering to an extent

2. Prevents overbudgeting

3. Satisfied Client",The challenge that Target Value Design was created to address is to help prevent value engineering.
72,"The TVD kitchen metaphor. It was compared to a chef creating a gourmet meal within a fixed budget. The chef strategically designs the dish based on what customers are willing to pay. If they can't meet standards within the budget, they halt the project. Throughout, the chef tastes and adjusts, emphasizing iterative improvement. This highlights the importance of managing resources and planning effectively from the start in project management.","Budget wisely

73,Its main focus is to better improve communication between everyone and to align the values and ideas of the stakeholders better then is typically done.,"1st: I got a better understanding of the leadership roles you go through and how it should work.

2nd: I learned more about stakeholders and what their role is in a project.

3rd:Â  I learned how to be a better communicator in a company setting.",It was made to work on get stakeholders' values and ideas to align with the people who are building the project. Along with continuing to improve communication amongst parties.
74,"Target value design is a new innovative way that stakeholders might not like at first but can be very beneficial long term. TVD allows clear communication of the owners of wants and needs. Data is then created to minimize waste, value optimization and allow the project to decrease in price without losing the quality.","* TVD is new and innovative.

* Decreases waste of project without losing value and project of the owner

* Views clients wants & needs as input for design and construction.Â ",I think TVD was created to help address the wants and needs of the owner while driving down the cost of a project and not compromising the quality. This can help reduce the waste of a project and help create trust with the team and stakeholders.Â 
75,Target Value Design allows for more fluidity and adjustment during the construction and planning process.,"Every project is going to have issues, we can plan around those issues as long as we take the proper steps, and the issues that we will face always have a solution, and usually that solution is more time or money.",Money restrictions and timeframe issues.
76,"I remembered from the case study that the TVD helped combat all the dilemmas which were: cost, scope, change, team, and stakeholder management.","TVD addresses the challenges faced during a project

Hence, there are no discrepancies when the cost goes over budget or under. Designing to the budget instead of budgeting to the design.",the budget and how you can cut costs at the beginning to meet the budget
85,"TVD is a project management approach used to align project goals, budget constraints and design outcomes within a predefined budget/cost target. There's an emphasis on collaboration among stakeholders, owners, designers, contractors and end users to optimize project value while controlling costs.","TVD emphasizes aligning project cost and schedule targets to control expenses and minimize delays. Collaboration among stakeholders is crucial for shared understanding and proactive problem-solving throughout the project lifecycle. By prioritizing value optimization and effective risk management, TVD promotes efficient execution and successful project outcomes.","TVD in construction management addresses challenges like cost overruns, schedule delays, and inefficient resource allocation. It sets clear cost and schedule targets from the outset to control expenses and minimize delays. TVD emphasizes collaboration among stakeholders to optimize value and mitigate risks by identifying and addressing potential issues early in the project lifecycle. Overall, TVD aims to foster efficient project execution, aligning goals, optimizing resources, and managing risks to deliver successful outcomes."
86,TVD is a process where a fix budget and goals to meet are the foundation for a construction bid.Â ,"Think on your feet, problem solve, and database EVERYTHING to get better results.Â ",A hard target makes hitting the bullseye very much more difficult.Â  TVD though was implemented to try to stop cost overlays and ballooning budgets.Â Â 
87,I remember the hospital example showed a new hospital was needed however the costs were over the budget. We had to decide whether or not to go through with building the new hospital or not. I decided the project should be postponed so the contractor/owner could regroup and find cheaper alternatives.,"The three takeaways I got from the TVD lesson was to review the situation, discuss alternatives, and then decide what the best options are for the project.",TVD was created to address financial security and profitability of a project and the means to complete it. If a project can't be completed within budget there will be losses and we have to figure out if it is worth the risk.
88,"Target Value Design (TVD) is a methodology aimed at achieving maximum value for a construction project while staying within budget constraints. In the case study, Topnotch Health is planning to build a new healthcare campus, facing challenges such as financial constraints, conflicting stakeholder needs, uncertainty, and the need for collaborative teamwork.","The three key takeaways from the Target Value Design (TVD) lesson are:

*

Value Optimization within Budget Constraints: TVD focuses on maximizing project value within budget limits, as seen in Topnotch Health's need to balance features with financial constraints.

*

Collaborative Stakeholder Engagement: TVD requires collaboration among stakeholders with diverse needs, emphasizing transparent communication and consensus-building.

*

Flexibility to Address Uncertainty: TVD acknowledges the need to adapt to changing circumstances, underscoring the importance of proactive risk management and agile project practices.","Overall, TVD addresses the challenges of cost management, scope management, change management, team management, and stakeholder engagement by promoting collaborative decision-making, value-driven design, and iterative planning processes throughout the project lifecycle."
89,"Target value Design is when the design of the project is trying to be completed under a certain budget while using certain practices to keep members , such as stakeholders well I formed throughout the process.","Communication is a big factor , paying attention to budget while selected the best material, Listening to the wants needs and must haves from stakeholders and creating a plan to implement something from all.","I believe it was created to address issues in the industry such as communication and delays. TVD tackles these issues and promotes better communication amongst members.

2. The alternative solutionsÂ 

3. Health care needs",Itâ€™s used to address the needs of the people who will be using the facility or people who are effected by the project .
91,"Target Value Design is to help talk about dilemmas, and what you can do to overcome them, as well as marking what you really need, and if you can go further, complete those wants as well.","* Working together brings our thoughts together

* Outlining needs and wants helps separate priorities out

* The sooner we discuss dilemmas the better","I think TVD was created to address the challenges that we face in construction when we want to keep everyone happy, which is not feasible. So we must come up with a system where we can check off what we really need, and if we have the ability to, meet other wants as well.Â "
92,"Target value design was used throughout the case study to help with figuring out the cost of the project, and what can and cannot be afforded.","That TVD can help with delivering successful projects, help meet client expectations, and help with figuring out cost of the project.","TVD helps with cost overruns, misaligned objectives, value engineering, design integration, and continues improvement.

97,"I remember that Target Value Design (TVD) is all about strategically managing costs and aligning project goals. It involves setting target costs early on and designing to meet them, ensuring projects stay financially feasible. TVD emphasizes collaboration and continuous improvement to optimize project scope and deliver value. It also helps in addressing uncertainties and managing risks effectively, ensuring projects adapt to changes while staying within budget constraints. Overall, TVD is a comprehensive approach for cost-effective and high-quality construction projects.","For me, the three key takeaways from the target value design lesson were:

*

Early Cost Planning: Setting target costs early in the project lifecycle is crucial for ensuring financial feasibility and aligning project goals with available resources.

*

Continuous Improvement: Emphasizing continuous improvement and collaboration among stakeholders is essential for optimizing project scope and delivering value to project owners.

*

Risk Management: Target value design provides a structured approach to managing uncertainties and risks in construction projects, enabling project teams to adapt to changing circumstances while staying within budget constraints.","In my opinion, Target Value Design (TVD) was developed to tackle various challenges in our industry, notably in cost management, scope alignment, and uncertainty. It's aimed at ensuring projects remain within budget constraints while meeting quality standards and stakeholder expectations. Personally, I believe TVD is crucial for managing scope effectively and addressing uncertainties by setting target costs early in the project lifecycle and continuously improving project strategies."
98,TVD at its core looks to reduce the costs of a project while effectively keeping the design and quality of a project still relatively high in comparison. An example would be keeping the hospital floor-to-floor heights lower so that less structural load is being carried and less materials are also being used.,"1. TVD aims to reduce cost at its core, while still maintaining or increasing the project's overall value.

2. Cooperation and trust between team members and stakeholders within a project is important to pull off effective TVD.

3. Compromises must be made.",The main challenge that TVD was created to address was cost. TVD helps significantly drive down the cost of a project without reducing the project's overall quality or extending its schedule.
99,"It helped visually show the market cost, allowable cost, and target cost. Also helped show us a timeline on when the TVD is applied from the schematic through the CD estimate and helped us understand its role through the project phases","Improved time based insights, Enhanced Decision making, Predictive capabilities","TVD was probably made to help deal with data that changes over time. Like in finance or weather, where the information is always updating. It likely helps make sense of this changing data, finding patterns, and making predictions.

When only so much money is spread across all of those areas how are you able to save money and earn the most money for your work?Â  TVD allows everyone: owners, stakeholders, constructors, etc. To all be happy and work for the best and most efficient way for all.Â "
107,"TVD is a way to target dilemmas and potential issues within the construction process. The study issued many dilemmas such as budget issues, delaying the overall project timeline and what materials needed to be used.Â ","1.) How to adaptive to new budget allocations to fit everyone's needs

2.) Selection of material based on price and safety

3.) How to manage with motivating stake holders to complete the project on time without any delays","TVD is important for the construction industry because it helps prevent any future issues with construction financial risks/problems, legal issues or facing dilemmas with other stake holders within the project parameters."
108,Target Value Design has CM at risk as they play both CM and GC. Since they play both roles they are more invovled in the project as soon at it starts. This allows for them to talk to the owner in order to reduce costs and address their needs.Â ,"CM is at Risk

More open communication, uses system thinking process in order to understand how the actions of one department in construction can affect the other.

You can create a point system process in order to determine which is the best material to pick within you project.",Target Value Design seems very simiar to how LEED projects are designed. It uses a lot of system thinking in order to avoid going over budget as well as having the upmost communication.
109,The stake holders had three different bids for the hospital and they were trying to find the best bid that offered the best building practices that they needed.

121,"It's not about picking the most expensive option in a project, rather, its about choosing what options work best and are ""the most bang for your buck"". In the case study, it dealt with the ""choosing by advantages"" method to pick the parts of the hospital, such as exterior walls, that would rate the highest in price and performance compared to all the options.","* Ideally , the goal is to increase project value while cutting expenses

* Cutting can be flexible with more being taken from some areas and less in others

* Choosing by advantages and making a graph makes it clear how the most expensive or cheapest is not always the best choice",I believe it was created as a method for getting to the target cost as much as possible. The challenge of compromising to meat financial goals is the main target of TVD. It's a method that introduces different ways to meet the lower end price such as cutting from the beginning. T

2. For TVD to work need to work as team

3. Engaging stakeholders is importantÂ ",I believe TVD was created to address spending too much on overqualified material. In other words to get the most out of the target budget.
140,"Based off of the case study, Target Value Design allowed us to look at different exterior wall systems for the hospital facades and decide on the best fit.","* When managing teams with multiple thoughts on the route to take, target value design can help narrow it down.

* Cutting from the beginning before design and detailed estimation.

* Information obtained from this method can be plotted for an easy visual to pick the best option and present to stakeholders.","When working in larger groups, it is hard for everyone to all agree on the same ideas. Target Value Design solves these issues by allowing the whole team to work together to place these ideas on a scale and narrow it down to one thing that everyone can agree on."
141,It is a process of the designing a project to meet or be under a certain price point to make the project affordable.Â ,Make sure you understand your customers budget up front.,"Some areas are getting more costly to build in, so it helps to be able to design your build to be cost effective the first time, not the seconded time."
142,"Target Value Design includes choosing by advantages, system thinking, adaptive leadership, and co-location. This means cutting from the beginning of the project before detailed estimation comes in and the designs are made. This prevents losing more money to cutting after most things are done.Â ","Make the best choice for the whole team, cost efficient, and time efficient.Â ","It's used to address how we communicate with our team and buyers to make a better job site. It also helps the project move faster and more smoothly. For instance, choosing by advantages shows the team which features are more important and how they compare to the cost.Â "
143,"The TVD process is constrained to a budget from the start of a project, unlike other processes where a price is given once the project is finished. This process promotes collaboration in the team.Â ","-TVD promotes collaboration.

-TVD is constrained to a price.

-The design of the project can change to meet clients' budget.Â ",TVD was created to address cost management of big projects so that value can be given to the client while the company and its workers can work with a profit incentive.Â 
144,"I remember that a way of resolving conflicts is moving the budget around from subcontractor to sub-contractor to maximize the budget. To keep moral up, incentives (e.g., bonuses) can be given to the entire team for their comprehension.Â ","1. Even if we have a large budget, we need to be wise when making design decisions. In other words, ""don't blow all the money"". This can ensure the profit margin is higher or we can complete the project without needing all of the client's money, which can create an incentive for them to continue doing projects with us.Â 

2. Choosing by advantages can be use to resolve issues in the TVD method.Â 

3. Collaboration and communication is essential to reaching consensus and keeping your team's moral high when you are the PM.Â ","Target Value Design was most likely created to resolve conflicts between stakeholders. The outcome of the process is to come to a consensus that makes everyone feel heard while meeting budgetary constraints. In simple terms, it is the process of finding the ""sweet spot"" between cost and meeting all client demands.Â "
145,I know that target value design contains methods that act as a guide through basic challenges and dilemmas in the industry.Â ,"1. Whatever issues you run into, it is almost guaranteed that somebody else has already solved that problem and you can learn from their methods.Â

Not every aspect of the project is going to be met as intended all the time. Everyone works together no matter what department you are in.Â ,"Communication between all teams. There is so much work that goes into a building or any other construction, not just engineering. It is important that everyone communicates with each other and does what is best for the client.Â "
148,NA,"The three biggest key takeaways for me would be the methods used for cost management, team management, and stakeholder management.Â ","TVD was designed to address budgeting issues within the industry. This can be in the form of preventing overbudgeting, making a project as economical as possible; also for projects with a set amount of funding available, in which they need a project to be around their set amount of funding.Â Â "

3. and I donâ€™t rememberÂ ",Target value design is a way to make the owner of the project and design of the construction to run smoothlyÂ 
154,Target value design is a project management strategy designed to allow all necessary components and needs of a project to be met by selectively and pre-emptively choosing the most important design elements of a project and cutting on necessary ones.Â ,"Target value design is effective, not as costly, and provides a better result.","Target value design, from my understanding, is a project budget management system designed to help project managers, stakeholders, and consultants meet all elements of a project such as necessary design features, budget, and scheduling concerns.Â "
155,TVD helps to visualize and differentiate the each part of the project and which ones to prioritize over the others.,"Must have criteria, target costing and choosing by advantages",Organizing and operating a project efficientlyÂ 
156,Target Value Design is a project planning method where every person working on the project from the start is designing/working in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. This eliminates the issues that arise when designs are completed with respect to a certain budget and are then needing to be adjusted/toned down due to a budget cut.,"1. It is better to plan smart from the beginning instead of needing to make difficult changes/decisions at the end

2. Building sustainably is not only a benefit for the environment, but it sometimes also can save money on the long run.

3.Â  Target Value Design is not only concerned with saving money, but also in saving time. Just as is important to leave more available money in the budget than you really need, it is also equally important to give yourself ""buffer time"".Â ",TVD was created to address the problems with trying to cut costs or cut time when the project is already nearing completion. It also addresses the issues relative to the effect of price increases and changes from the owner.
157,"From the case study and presentation, TVD was designed to create a more integrated and collaborative approach to project delivery, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and with a focus on delivering maximum value to the owner and other stakeholders.","The first key takeaway from Target Value Design (TVD) is the importance of collaboration and integration among all project stakeholders from the outset, ensuring that everyone works towards a common goal that aligns with the project's budget and value targets. Second, is that cost control should be a continuous process throughout the design and construction phases, rather than something addressed only after the design is complete. This proactive approach helps prevent budget overruns and ensures that the project delivers maximum value within financial constraints. The last key takeaway is TVD emphasizes the importance of focusing on value rather than merely cutting costs, encouraging decisions that enhance the project's overall utility and long-term benefits, even if they involve higher initial investments.","Target Value Design (TVD) was created to address several challenges in the construction and design industry, particularly those related to cost management, stakeholder alignment, and the complexity of large-scale projects. I'd say the key challenges such as cost management, stakeholder collaboration, managing scope and quality, and flexibility and change management."
158,The big take away I got from TVD is that it's an efficient way to manage a project that meets the requirements while remaining within a budget.,"1. Choosing by advantages table - what provides the most value relative to its cost

2. Scope/stakeholder requirements - understanding what the owner prioritizes for the projectÂ 

3. Be flexible in the design and planning - to account for unexpected fluctuations and costs",TVD was created to optimize and efficiently use the budget of a project. It does this by breaking down all the materials and costs of a project and categorizing them by which ones are most advantageous.
159,"TVD involves applying different methods to make decisions when faced with limited budget. One of them is choosing by advantage, also adaptation leadership, and system thinking.","Budget constrains make the engineers life so much more difficult than it needs to be. Also, cutting budgets requires a deep understanding of construction methods to not reduce the budget of something important.",Mostly budget constraints. Answering how to operate a large project with less budget than needed and risks. If every project had infinite budget there will be no need for compromising on anything in the construction processÂ 
160,"I remember 5 ""dilemmas"" in the case study consisting of Cost management, scope management, change management, team management, and stakeholder engagement.Â ","To keep a clear line of communication open with all stakeholders, do not be afraid of change and take appropriate action when necessary, and how to choose the best yet most cost-effective materials to use.Â ",TVD was created to ensure that the customer would get exactly what they wanted while working within their financial and time constrains.
161,TVD is designed to cut costs before the design is done and if it isn't feasible then the project will be stopped before construction starts. Within TVD they choose materials due to their advantages over others for the project.,"* Create designs with a certain budget

* Choose materials based on their advantages and not their cost

* Changing certain parts of a project can lead to saving on costs","TVD was created to address businesses having to cut corners near the end of construction due to a lack of available funds, leading to a lower quality project that the owner may not be satisfied with, but TVD allows for a design to be constructed with a certain budget in mind to ensure they're are enough funds for the planned construction with potential leeway in case of unexpected circumstances.Â "
162,"What I remembered about target value design is that it applies the principles of target costing to project delivery, focusing on setting cost as a design constraint rather than an outcome.",be great at communicating with people. think before acting. Needs come before wants.,"TVD assists in incorporating sustainable practices into the project from the outset, in line with the growing emphasis on sustainability."
163,Target Value Design is a range of prices based on the design of the building.Â ,"-meeting owner wants & needs

-idea for better project managementÂ 

-choosing by advantage method",The challenge of disorganization.Â 
164,TVD is a method in construction where projects are designed to meet a set budget from the start this focuses on giving the client the most value.Â ,"TVD puts the client first, allows for more collaboration in the beginning and is a efficient way to run a project",I think TVD was created to address cost overruns and inefficient collaborationÂ 
165,"Target Value Design is a series of ideologies and methodologies that can be used to help manage the overall cost expenditure of a project, with ways to best utilize each method determined by the nature of the project.","1. Although it is ultimately impossible to please everyone completely, by attempting to do so while accepting failure, you can achieve great things that otherwise seemed impossible.

2. Although there are multiple types of target value design, one of the most efficient options in a big picture sense might be system thinking, as this puts the needs of the individual aside for the collective.

3. When choosing by advantages, despite different variables having different levels of significance, there are times where it is objectively better to pick an option with a worse variable, due to it excelling in a different variable, and how to go about making this decision.","Within the context of engineering, Target Value Design was created to help address the issues regarding budget, how to lower the budget being used, and how to achieve it in a way to where everyone walks away without feeling slighted."
166,"In order to meet its budget, the hospital must manage which of its systems should have cut costs or not be installed initially.","Target value design can be used to effectively cut costs, use efficient spending, and work out issues with sponsors and subcontractors.","TVD was created to address the problems of cutting costs at a flat rate across all systems, as this causes more problems than by going over each system separately."
167,"TVD in the case study was used to help find a balance in spending by meeting expectations of ""need to haves"" and still ensuring that, if possible, the ""want to haves"" are met as well while still staying within an acceptable budget and time frame. This concept helped not only our group but the whole class discuss different possibilities of how we would approach the issues faced in the case study.","1. Engineers play a vital role in budget balance and designÂ 

2. Budget is an evolving constraint during the process of the project

3. Contracts vary project to project",TVD was designed to address spending issues that arise throughout the project and is used to create a free flowing budget among the systems. Also it was designed in order for more creative input to drive efficiency and to better understand the scope of the project.
168,I remember the goal of trying to match the price that the owner can afford per square foot by using multiple methods or approaches.Â ,"The cost management, change management, and the Team management","In my opinion it was created to address unforeseen conditions, to help the owners financially, combat inflation, and to help improve the overall infrastructure of the united states.Â "
169,I recall the process of weighing additional costs with their complimentary benefits.,"Must haves, budget allocation, cutting costs","TVD was created to address shortcomings in large projects. It takes a step back at each step in order to reevaluate the goal, budget, etc."
170,The case study mentioned target value design as a method to align project costs with the client's budget by designing to a target cost rather than adjusting the budget to meet design needs. I also remember how target value design includes early contact with stakeholders and construction processes to manage costs,"- Early collaboration among stakeholders is key
- Design to the target cost, not adjust costs to the design
- Focus on maximizing value while staying within budget",Risk management & budget control
171,"The Target Value Design primarily consists of system thinking, advantageous planning, and adaptive leadership. These allow for the construction process to run smoother.","* Advantageous planning

* Systematic thinking

* Adaptive leadership","Target Value Design was created to reduce costs after the design process but also mitigates any plans that may change during construction. The most important reasoning for the development of this strategy is to create clear communication to ensure economic, safety, and aesthetic through the most effective means."
172,Target value design is the system for leadership and sustainability in projects that keep them on a clean and clear path. The plan has a lot of different paths that spending and such can be divided with a very hard to identify clear answer such as what we saw in the case study.Â Â ,"The three takeaway topics that I saw in this lesson were Target value design and how to implement it, Project expectations, and integrated project delivery.","In my industry TVD is created to address the time versus money spent for civil engineers. They have adaptive leaderships so that people will have a chain of command in project and listen to the people above them. System thinking is also important for the sustainability of the project, less specific to cost but just a more efficient way to build.Â "
173,I remember the way that we as project managers have to understand the level of hierarchy in a project when going to others for decisions as well as producing deliverables that are sound engineering wise and get as much needs and wants from the buyer as possible.,"Plan well (Start, Continue, Finish)

Stay collaborative cant do the whole project onÂ  your own.

choosing by advantages method is a highly effective tool for decision making.",I feel it was implemented because project management was probably a lot more sporadic and chaotic. In fighting and differing opinions would cause plans to drag along and stall thus costing more money.
174,Target Value Design allows companies to design for projects to fit a specific budget.,"1) Cost cuts don't have to be equal by trade, you should do what is best for the project overall

2) Just because one aspect of an element in design is better does not mean that the element is necessary the best choice for the project

3) Trying to appease every stakeholder is hard!

Â ",It was created to address the challenges of a very low project budget.
175,Target Value Design is important for maximizing the budget and aligning the design process with the budget. The design and cost analysis are taken into account together.,"Optimizing the design to fit the budget, creating buy-in with the owner and stakeholder team, and performing cost analyses.","TVD addresses budget cuts, overrun budgets, and efficiency in the design process."
176,"Target value design sets a target value that the project homes to meet to save money, but also considers a higher allowable cost so that the project will still continue even if the target cost is exceeded.","Plan ahead, allow flexibility in your budget, and prioritize some criteria over others.","In my understanding, TVD was made to address projects going over budget or spending more money than was necessary."
177,I understand that there are a lot of moving parts to TVD from the case study. There was 6 dilemmas that we went over that each helped encompass the idea of TVD. I believe that TVD has a lot of responsibility but that responsibility can be distributed.,"Choosing by advantages

Adaptive Leadership

System thinking",Some challenges TVD was created to address could possibly be how to work together as a cohesive unit in a better way that allows more voices to be heard and understood. With the concepts of adaptive leadership and system thinking you are able to understand the project as a whole much better.
